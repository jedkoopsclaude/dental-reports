## Hydra Orchestration Toolkit

Hydra is a Lead-driven orchestration toolkit. You (the Lead) make strategic
decisions at decision points; Hydra handles operational management.
`result.json` is the only completion evidence.

Why this design (vs. other coding-agent products):
- **SWF decider pattern, specialized for LLM deciders.** Hydra is the AWS SWF / Cadence / Temporal decider pattern. `hydra watch` is `PollForDecisionTask`; the Lead is the decider; `lead_terminal_id` enforces single-decider semantics.
- **Parallel-first, not bolted on.** `dispatch` + worktree + `merge` are first-class. Lead sequences nodes manually and passes context explicitly via `--context-ref`. Other products treat parallelism as open research; Hydra makes it the default.
- **Typed result contract.** Workers publish a schema-validated `result.json` (`outcome: completed | stuck | error`, optional `stuck_reason: needs_clarification | needs_credentials | needs_context | blocked_technical`). Other products return free-text final messages and require downstream parsing.
- **Lead intervention points.** `hydra reset --feedback` lets the Lead actually intervene at decision points instead of being block-and-join. A stale or wrong run is one `reset` away.

Core rules:
- Root cause first. Fix the implementation problem before changing tests.
- Do not hack tests, fixtures, or mocks to force a green result.
- Do not add silent fallbacks or swallowed errors.
- An assignment run is only complete when `result.json` exists and passes schema validation.

Workflow patterns:
1. Do the task directly when it is simple, local, or clearly faster without workflow overhead.
2. Use Hydra for ambiguous, risky, parallel, or multi-step work:
   ```
   hydra init --intent "<task>" --repo .
   hydra dispatch --workbench W --dispatch <id> --role <role> --intent "<desc>" --repo .
   hydra watch --workbench W --repo .
   # → DecisionPoint returned, decide next step
   hydra complete --workbench W --repo .
   ```
3. Use a direct isolated worker when only a separate worker is needed:
   `hydra spawn --task "<specific task>" --repo . [--worktree .]`

Agent launch rule:
- When dispatching Claude/Codex through TermCanvas CLI, start a fresh agent terminal with `termcanvas terminal create --prompt "..."`
- Do not use `termcanvas terminal input` for task dispatch; it is not a supported automation path

TermCanvas Computer Use:
- TermCanvas may dynamically inject a Computer Use MCP server into Claude/Codex terminals; it does not have to appear in static MCP settings files.
- For local macOS desktop apps or system UI, check for TermCanvas Computer Use before assuming only shell, browser, or Playwright tools are available.
- If available, call `status` first, then `setup` if permissions or helper health are missing, then `get_instructions` for the current operating protocol.
- Do not manually start `computer-use-helper`, write its state file, launch the MCP server, or hand-write JSON-RPC unless explicitly debugging Computer Use itself.

Workflow control:
- After dispatching, always call `hydra watch`. It returns at decision points.
1. Watch until decision point: `hydra watch --workbench <workbenchId> --repo .`
2. Inspect structured state: `hydra status --workbench <workbenchId> --repo .`
3. Reset a dispatch for rework: `hydra reset --workbench W --dispatch N --feedback "..." --repo .`
4. Approve a dispatch's output: `hydra approve --workbench W --dispatch N --repo .`
5. Merge parallel branches: `hydra merge --workbench W --dispatches A,B --repo .`
6. View event log: `hydra ledger --workbench <workbenchId> --repo .`
7. Clean up: `hydra cleanup --workbench <workbenchId> --repo .`

Telemetry polling:
1. Treat `hydra watch` as the main polling loop; do not infer progress from terminal prose alone.
2. Before deciding wait / retry / takeover, query:
   - `termcanvas telemetry get --workbench <workbenchId> --repo .`
   - `termcanvas telemetry get --terminal <terminalId>`
   - `termcanvas telemetry events --terminal <terminalId> --limit 20`
3. Trust `derived_status` and `task_status` as the primary decision signals.

`result.json` must contain (slim, schema_version `hydra/result/v0.1`):
- `schema_version`, `workbench_id`, `assignment_id`, `run_id` (passthrough IDs)
- `outcome` (completed/stuck/error — Hydra routes on this)
- `report_file` (path to a `report.md` written alongside `result.json`)

All human-readable content (summary, outputs, evidence, reflection) lives in
`report.md`. Hydra rejects any extra fields in `result.json`. Write `report.md`
first, then publish `result.json` atomically as the final artifact of the run.

When NOT to use: simple fixes, high-certainty tasks, or work that is faster to do directly in the current agent.

## TermCanvas Pin System

TermCanvas has a first-class pin store. Pins are persistent records of work
the user wants done — captured when the user expresses intent, not when the
work happens. Use the `termcanvas pin` CLI to read and write them. Any agent
terminal can record, read, and update pins.

When to record a pin:
- User says "记一下", "回头处理", "帮我留意", "later", "todo this", or any phrasing that defers the work.
- User describes a problem or idea but isn't asking you to fix it right now.
- User pastes a GitHub issue URL and asks you to track it (record the URL via `--link`).

Do NOT silently nod — capture the pin with `termcanvas pin add` so it survives the session.

Recording a pin:
```
termcanvas pin add --title "<short imperative>" --body "<detail>" [--link <url>]
```
- `--title`: short, scannable. Rephrase the user's words into imperative mood.
- `--body`: longer description, including any context the user gave.
- `--link <url>`: attach an external reference (GitHub issue, doc, etc.). Use `--link-type github_issue` for issue URLs.
- Repo defaults to cwd. Pass `--repo <path>` only if you need a different one.

Reading and updating pins:
- `termcanvas pin list` — list pins for the current repo (filter `--status done` etc.)
- `termcanvas pin show <id>` — read a single pin before acting on it
- `termcanvas pin update <id> --status done` — mark complete after finishing the work
- `termcanvas pin update <id> --body "..."` — refine the description as you learn more

Rules:
- Pins belong to the user. Don't invent pins the user didn't ask for.
- One pin per intent. Three deferred items = three `pin add` calls.
- After completing work that originated from a pin, call `pin update <id> --status done`.
- The pin store is local to TermCanvas. It does NOT auto-sync to GitHub. If the user wants something on GitHub, they will say so explicitly.
- Status values: `open` (default), `done`, `dropped`. Pick `dropped` (not delete) when a pin is abandoned, so the history is preserved.
